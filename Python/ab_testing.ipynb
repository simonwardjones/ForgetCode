    "In an AB test we split the users into different groups; the control group stays with the same experience or product and then the other groups each receive a variation of this (often there is only one other variant).

We want to run an AB test to see if changing the styling of a key product page increases the conversion. The users are randomly split into two groups, we show the control group the old website and we show the users in the variant group the modified styling. We run the test for a period of time and observe how many from each group go on to purchase - we then calculate the statistics to determine whether the conversion rate has improved for the new style.\n",
